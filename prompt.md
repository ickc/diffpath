Write a [LANGUAGE] program that implements a command-line tool called `diffpath` with the following specifications:

1. **Usage**: `diffpath PATH1 PATH2`
   - `PATH1` and `PATH2` are UNIX-style PATH variables (colon-separated lists of directories).

2. **Program Requirements**:
    - **Path Splitting**:
        - Split each PATH variable into individual directories.
    - **Executable Discovery**:
        - For each directory, identify all executable files (regular files with any execute permission).
    - **Collection of Executable Filenames**:
        - Create a collection of executable filenames (not full paths) for each PATH.
    - **Output the Diff**:
        - Compare the two collections and output the difference in a format similar to `comm -3`:
            - Include items unique to either `PATH1` or `PATH2`.
            - Sort these items.
            - Print each item in this combined sorted order.
            - Prefix items from `PATH2` with a tab character.

3. **Collection Choice**:
    - Choose the best type of collection (e.g., sets, lists) based on the requirements. Use only the standard library.

4. **Additional Information**:
    - **Toolchain Details**:
        - **Formatters**: Recommend a code formatter and justify why it is the best choice for [LANGUAGE].
        - **Compilers**: Recommend a compiler and justify why it is the best choice for [LANGUAGE].
        - **Optimization Options**: Suggest optimization options to be used when compiling the program and explain their benefits.
